# RealEstateWebScraping

In this project, I'm going to collect data from a Real Estate website using the Beautiful Soup library and Python. Beautiful Soup is a powerful python library specifically designed for parsing HTML.
I will be extracting the following information: Address of the property, Price, Number of beds and baths, area of the property, lot size, and link to the property.All this information is available in the HTML code that can be easy accesed by inspecting the website.
After collecting data next step was to apply data cleaning, and finaly to save data as csv for further analysis.
